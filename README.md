Peer Review: Richard Johnson - The program runs as intended, taking the user's name and what time they woke up that morning.
I noticed that the response always says that the time you woke up is early, which is a fun way for the console to print the response.
I think it adds more personality to the text printed in the console. The replay function also works the way it should, letting the user type "yes" to play again, or "no" to exit. However, it only works if the user types "yes" or "y" lowercase, or "no" or "n" lowercase,
with no other casing implemented. I think using a "ToUpper" or "ToLower" function would be a good idea here. Other than that, though, 
the program works the way it's supposed to.
